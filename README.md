## Note
This repository extends the its predessesor that can be found [here](https://github.com/aidanlenahan/dev/tree/main/ps/cyberpatriot/masterbible24-25/windows). This evolved from just another coding project to a bigger project which has become much more helpful and useful than I initially thought, so I put it in it's own repository.
